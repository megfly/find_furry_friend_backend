# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# require 'faker'

# 3.times do
#     Shelter.create(
#       name: Faker::Company.name,
#       street_address: Faker::Address.street_address,
#       city: Faker::Address.city,
#       state: Faker::Address.state,
#       zipcode: Faker::Address.zip_code,
#       email: Faker::Internet.email,
#       phone: Faker::PhoneNumber.phone_number
#     )
